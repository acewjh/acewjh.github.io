Dr. Jiahao Wang is currently a research engineer in **AI safety and governance** at Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. He received his PhD and B.S. degrees in Computer Science from Beihang University in 2022 and 2017 respectively. He also worked as a research intern in Meituan in 2021. Supervised by Prof. [Yunhong Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0ez7lA0AAAAJ) at [IRIP Lab](https://irip.buaa.edu.cn/), Jiahao’s major research interest during PhD was computer vision and video understanding, where he focused on how to utilize **few-shot, unsupervised** and other representation learning methods to facilitate AI **understanding human behaviors accurately and reliably.** It was also from then Jiahao has begun to pay attention to the trustworthiness and safety issues of AI. After joining Huawei, he started in-depth research in AI safety and governance, with a particular focus on **AI alignment, hallucination mitigation** and other cutting-edge areas like AI transparency and data governance.
